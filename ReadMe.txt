EuterpeaLite
Website: http://www.euterpea.com

This is a MINIMAL version of Euterpea that only includes Euterpea's Music 
types and support for MIDI file import/export. There is no signal processing 
back-end (no WAV file export) and no MIDI streaming functionality (no play 
function). This is intended for systems that have compatbility problems with 
the dependencies of the full version that are needed for MIDI streaming and 
audio. Most users should use the full version of Euterpea.
